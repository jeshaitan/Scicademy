                <p>Scicademy is an open-access, <a href="https://www.github.com/jeshaitan/Scicademy">open source</a>, student research database. </p>
                <hr />
                <h2 id="goal_about">Our Goal</h2>
                <p>Our goal at Scicademy is to allow students all over the globe to share their hard work and love of science with their peers, potential employers, and colleges. High school and undergraduate research is valuable and shouldn't be discounted,
                    regardless of whether the research was conducted in school or with a high-level research institution. Here at Scicademy, we know that the youth of today are the researchers of tomorrow, and we created Scicademy with that in mind.</p>

                <h3>Can anybody steal my work and claim it as their own?</h3>
                <p>All work published on this website by any user is licensed under the
                    <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. If you go to your paper's page, you can see the CC BY button assuring that your paper is licensed.
                </p>
                <h3>What restrictions apply when I'm submitting a paper?</h3>
                <p>When you submit a paper, you are agreeing to Scicademy's <a href="TermsandConditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href="PrivacyPolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Don't worry, these conditions just make sure that you've cited all
                    your literature and given credit to all researchers who you use materials from. If you worked in a research institution with a mentor to perform your project, the terms state that your mentor knows that his/her research will be open
                    for everyone to see, and his/her consent is given for it to be so.
                </p>
                <h3>What is a User Id?</h3>
                <p>Every user on Scicademy is assigned a random number upon registration. That is your User Id. It is used to store which papers belong to you.</p>
                <!--<h3>Why does my paper not show up in results after I submit it?</h3>-->
                <!--<p>Relax. All legitimate research projects are accepted to Scicademy, however your project must go through a slight verification process, where we correct any grammatical and/or spelling mistakes in your project's title and abstract, and-->
                <!--make sure no illegal or inappropriate content is in your pdf. This process may take anywhere from one to three days.</p>-->
                <h3>How do I utilize Scicademy's search effectively?</h3>
                <p>By default, you search papers by 'All Fields,' which means by Title, Keywords, and User Id. If you want to search effectively, try narrowing your search parameters by checking off a different search option. If you want to search by name,
                    check off the 'Author' search option.
                </p>
