# Scicademy - Read, Research, Review
## Scicademy is an open-access, open source, student research database.

Our goal at Scicademy is to allow students all over the globe to share their hard work and love of science with their peers, potential employers, and colleges. High school and undergraduate research is valuable and shouldn't be discounted, regardless of whether the research was conducted in school or with a high-level research institution. Here at Scicademy, we know that the youth of today are the researchers of tomorrow, and we created Scicademy with that in mind.

If you're a teacher or a student and you want to bring Scicademy to your school, go right ahead. The more schools use it, the better it becomes.
